You can also reverse the order by setting the `reverse` parameter to `True`.\n\n```python\ndef sort_numbers(numbers, descending=False):\n    return sorted(numbers, reverse=descending)\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]\nsorted_numbers = sort_numbers(numbers_list)\n\nprint(\"Sorted numbers:\", sorted_numbers)  # Output will be in ascending order\n```\n\nIf you prefer to implement a sorting algorithm from scratch instead of using the built-in `sorted()` function, here's a simple implementation of the bubble sort algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(numbers):\n    n = len(numbers)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(0, n-i-1):\n            if numbers[j] > numbers[j+1]:\n                # Swap the elements\n                numbers[j], numbers[j+1] = numbers[j+1], numbers[j]\n    return numbers\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]\nsorted_numbers = bubble_sort(numbers_list)\n\nprint(\"Sorted numbers:\", sorted_numbers)\n```\n\nThis `bubble_sort` function will also sort the list of numbers in ascending order. Keep in mind that bubble sort is not the most efficient sorting algorithm for large datasets. For more efficient sorting, you might consider more advanced algorithms like quicksort or mergesort, but for simplicity, these examples should be sufficient for small lists.",
