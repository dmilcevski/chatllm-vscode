# Examples

This directory contains two examples of ChatLLM notebooks:
1. `demo.chatllm` is a simple demo that illustrates dynamic file inclusion, writing prompts in Markdown cells, and asking the system to implement sorting in Python and in C++.  It's intended to be extremely minimal and just give you a sense of how you might use the library.
2. `development.chatllm` contains my _actual_ logs from developing ChatLLM ... in a ChatLLM notebook.  It actually will throw some errors if you run it now, because I used it to write the commands to parse file inclusion, but now it will interpret these as file inclusion commands.  But more than anything, you can hopefully inspect this to get a sense of how I use the tool in practice.
