We create a list called `sieve` where each element is initially marked as `True`, to represent that every number is initially considered to be a prime candidate.\n2. We start from the first prime number, 2, and iterate through the sieve list.\n3. If we find a number marked as `True`, it means it's a prime (because it hasn't been marked as `False` by any previous numbers which would indicate that it's a multiple of some prime).\n4. We then add this number to the `primes` list.\n5. We proceed to mark all multiples of this found prime number as `False` starting from its square (optimization over starting from 2 * number) since it's guaranteed that all smaller numbers that are multiples of this number would have already been marked by smaller prime numbers.\n6. The function returns the list of primes that were found.",

Include `markdown-it` in your project and parse your markdown content to HTML.\n2. After parsing markdown to HTML with `markdown-it`, manipulate the HTML to add a copy button to each code block.\n3. Add the JavaScript functionality to make the copy button work.\n\nHere's a detailed guide and code sample to help you implement the \"copy\" button functionality:\n\n1. **Parse markdown to HTML using `markdown-it`:**\n   Make sure to include `markdown-it` in your project, for example, by using npm:\n   ```sh\n   npm install markdown-it\n   ```\n   Then use it in your code like this:\n   ```javascript\n   const MarkdownIt = require('markdown-it');\n   const md = new MarkdownIt();\n   \n   // Example markdown with a code block\n   const markdownContent = 'Here is some code:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconsole.log(\"Hello, world!\");\\n```';\n   \n   // Convert markdown to HTML\n   let htmlContent = md.render(markdownContent);\n   \n   // Continue with the next step before inserting the HTML into the document\n   ```\n\n2. **Manipulate HTML to add a copy button to each code block:**\n   Before you insert the parsed HTML into the DOM, you can add copy buttons to each code block using JavaScript:\n   ```javascript\n   const addCopyButtons = (html) => {\n     const parser = new DOMParser();\n     const doc = parser.parseFromString(html, 'text/html');\n     const codeBlocks = doc.querySelectorAll('pre code');\n\n     codeBlocks.forEach((codeBlock) => {\n       const button = doc.createElement('button');\n       button.className = 'copy-button';\n       button.textContent = 'Copy';\n       button.addEventListener('click', () => {\n         navigator.clipboard.writeText(codeBlock.textContent).then(() => {\n           button.textContent = 'Copied!';\n           setTimeout(() => (button.textContent = 'Copy'), 2000);\n         });\n       });\n       codeBlock.parentNode.insertBefore(button, codeBlock);\n     });\n\n     return doc.body.innerHTML;\n   };\n\n   // Add copy buttons to the HTML content\n   htmlContent = addCopyButtons(htmlContent);\n\n   // Now you can insert htmlContent into your document\n   document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = htmlContent;\n   ```\n\n3. **Add the CSS for the copy button:**\n   You might want to style your copy button with CSS. Here's a simple example you can include in your stylesheet:\n   ```css\n   .copy-button {\n     position: absolute;\n     top: 0.5em;\n     right: 0.5em;\n     cursor: pointer;\n   }\n\n   pre {\n     position: relative;\n   }\n   ```\n   \n   Do make sure that you have the necessary permissions to manipulate the clipboard as some browsers have restrictions on clipboard access to ensure user privacy and security.\n\n4. **Ensure the `navigator.clipboard` API is available:**\n   Note that the `navigator.clipboard` API might not be available in all browsers or scenarios (e.g., when not served over HTTPS or lacking user gesture). Ensure you handle such cases gracefully.\n\nThe `addCopyButtons` function above parses the given HTML string, iterates over each code block, appends a copy button, and assigns a click event listener to the button to copy the code block content. It then returns the modified HTML content that includes the copy buttons.\n   \nRemember to adjust your JavaScript and CSS to fit the styling and behavior you want, and make sure the script is loaded after the `markdown-it` output has been added to the DOM.",

Here's a rough guide on how you can implement a command that splits the output from the current cell and creates a markdown cell below with the output:\n\n1. **Set up an extension development environment**: If you haven't already, follow the VSCode extension development documentation to set up the environment and create a basic structure for your notebook extension.\n\n2. **Add a command to `package.json`**: In your extension's `package.json` file, add a new command declaration in the `contributes.commands` section.\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"contributes\": {\n       \"commands\": [\n         {\n           \"command\": \"notebook.splitOutput\",\n           \"title\": \"Split Output to Markdown Cell\"\n         }\n       ]\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Register the command**: In your extension's main JavaScript or TypeScript file (typically `extension.js` or `extension.ts`), register the command you just declared:\n\n   ```javascript\n   const vscode = require('vscode');\n\n   function activate(context) {\n\n     let disposable = vscode.commands.registerCommand('notebook.splitOutput', async () => {\n       const activeEditor = vscode.window.activeNotebookEditor;\n       if (activeEditor) {\n         const currentCell = activeEditor.document.cellAt(activeEditor.selection.active);\n         if (currentCell) {\n           const outputContent = currentCell.outputs.map(output => output.items.map(item => item.data.toString('utf8'))).join('\\n');\n           const markdownCellData = new vscode.NotebookCellData(\n             vscode.NotebookCellKind.Markup,\n             outputContent,\n             'markdown'\n           );\n           const newCells = [...activeEditor.document.cellCount];\n           newCells.splice(activeEditor.selection.active + 1, 0, markdownCellData);\n\n           const workspaceEdit = new vscode.WorkspaceEdit();\n           const notebookEdit = new vscode.NotebookEdit(activeEditor.document.uri, newCells);\n           workspaceEdit.set(activeEditor.document.uri, [notebookEdit]);\n           await vscode.workspace.applyEdit(workspaceEdit);\n         }\n       }\n     });\n\n     context.subscriptions.push(disposable);\n   }\n\n   function deactivate() {}\n\n   module.exports = {\n     activate,\n     deactivate\n   };\n   ```\n\n4. **Handle the output conversion**: In the registered command above, extract the output from the current cell, convert it to a markdown string as needed, and create a new markdown cell.\n\n5. **Apply a `WorkspaceEdit`**: Use `vscode.workspace.applyEdit()` to apply a `WorkspaceEdit` that inserts the new markdown cell below the current cell.\n\nRemember to handle the conversion of cell output to markdown according to the cell's mime type and specific output format. Not all output data might be suitable for simple string conversion, and some might require transformation (e.g., JSON output to formatted code block in markdown).\n\nAlso, ensure that your extension checks for the correct mime type and supports various output types from notebook cells. The actual conversion logic may vary based on the output types your notebook provides and how you want them represented in markdown.\n\nTest your extension thoroughly to make sure it behaves as expected and make sure to read the documentation on the [VSCode API for Notebook](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/notebook) to fully understand the involved classes and methods.

Here's the process to do so:\n\n### Step 1: Package the Extension\n\nFirst, you need to package your extension into a `.vsix` file using `vsce`, the Visual Studio Code Extension Manager. If you haven't already installed `vsce`, you can do so using npm:\n\n```sh\nnpm install -g vsce\n```\n\nNext, navigate to the root directory of your extension in your terminal and run:\n\n```sh\nvsce package\n```\n\nThis command will generate a `.vsix` file in your extension's directory. The file will be named according to the extension's name and version defined in the `package.json` file.\n\n### Step 2: Install the Extension into VSCode\n\nOnce you have the `.vsix` file, there are several ways you can install it into VSCode:\n\n#### Option 1: Use the Command Palette\n\n1. Open VSCode.\n2. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux, Cmd+Shift+P on macOS).\n3. Type `Extensions: Install from VSIX...` and select the command.\n4. Navigate to the directory where you have the `.vsix` file, select it, and click \"Open.\"\n\n#### Option 2: Use the Extensions View\n\n1. Open VSCode.\n2. Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+X (Cmd+Shift+X on macOS).\n3. Click on the `...` at the top-right of the Extensions view.\n4. Select \"Install from VSIX...\" from the dropdown menu.\n5. Find and select the `.vsix` file and click \"Open.\"\n\n#### Option 3: Install via CLI\n\nYou can also install the `.vsix` file via the command line by using the `code` command:\n\n```sh\ncode --install-extension your-extension-file.vsix\n```\n\nReplace `your-extension-file.vsix` with the path to your `.vsix` file.\n\n### Step 3: Reload VSCode\n\nAfter the installation, you may need to reload VSCode to activate the extension. This can usually be done with a prompt that appears asking you to reload the window after the installation.\n\n### Note:\n- Ensure that you have the publisher name, extension version, and all necessary fields correctly filled in your extension's `package.json` file before packaging.\n- If you're developing the extension and need to test changes frequently, consider using the \"Run Extension\" functionality available in the Run View (accessed via the Run icon in the Activity Bar) when you have the extension project open. This is a quick way to launch a new VSCode window with your extension running, without needing to package and install the `.vsix` each time.\n\nMake sure to test your extension thoroughly to ensure that it behaves correctly when installed this way.",
